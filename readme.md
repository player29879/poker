## Welcome to Nicolas Dickreuter's Python Pokerbot

Please visit the wiki page for documentation how to run the bot

You are welcome to contribute to this project in any shape or form (improving the software, doing data analysis, improving the GUI (based on Qt4 designer)). If you have any problems, contact me via dickreuter@yahoo.com.

This pokerbot plays automatically on Partypoker (Pokerstars version is also available). It works with image recognition, montecarlo simulation and a basic genetic algorithm. The mouse is moved automatically and the bot can play for hours. Captchas in Partypoker are sent to deathbycaptcha which has somebody resolve them usually within 15 seconds.
